   # Home Page
        -Search any superhero from the API and display the search results on the frontend (as I type the search results should update, just like Google does for     s            suggestions).
        -Each search result of the superhero should have a favourite button, clicking on which the superhero should be added to “My favourite superheroes” (a list).
         -On clicking any particular search result (any superhero), open a new page with more information about that superhero (Superhero page).
 
   # Superhero Page
        -Should show a lot of information about the superhero like their name, photo, powerstats, bio (these are must, rest you can add if you want).
 
  # My favourite superheroes Page
        -Display a list of all the favourite superheroes.
        -Make this list persistent (should have the same number of superheroes before and after closing the browser).
        -Remove from favourites button: Each superhero should have remove from favourites button, clicking on which should remove that superhero from the list.
